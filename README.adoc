== Titan + C* poc

Here are some results I measured on my laptop:


=== Tree

Creating a tree-like graph with 10k nodes and with exponential degree distribution:
* 3926ms
* 4230ms
* 4771ms

Sequentially going through all nodes and fetching the out going edges:
* 1597ms
* 2212ms
* 2841ms

Looking up one particuar node among 10k nodes without any index:
* 1324ms
* 2119ms
* 2633ms


=== Random Graph (DAG)

Creating the graph (10k nodes, probability of forming and edge = 0.00184):
* 6574ms
* 6257ms

Sequentially going through all nodes and fetching the out going edges:
* 2798ms
* 3535ms

Deleting the graph:
* 36974ms
* 36632ms
